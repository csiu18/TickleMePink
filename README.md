# TickleMePink

For our Senior Capstone project, we created an iPad application that allows researchers to create a sequence of stimuli and instructions, then hand off the device to participants to perform the experiment. Our sponsor is the Tufts Psychology Department.

## Background

Cognitive science research suggests that gesturing can facilitate learning.

Our sponsor is conducting a research study that involves training people with gestures and teaching trajectory.

The hope is that results will determine how quickly people are learning, whether new understandings transfer to new problems, and if gestures have some connection to learning and understanding.

## Problem & Solution

Currently, the only system that mimics the behavior needed for the study is mousetracker.org which is done through mouse and a computer.

The sponsor needs a system that facilitates the process of responding to tasks and stimuli through iPad gestures.

Our solution was to create an iPad application that would allow the sponsor to run research trials, with additional functionalities such as media uploading, trial customization, and extraction and exporting of data.

## Technologies Used

- Swift
- SwiftUI
- CoreData
- XCode
- GitHub
- Figma
- Jira

## Learning Outcomes

- How to design for a larger-scale orihect (acknowledging key risks and coming up with mitigation strategies, creating user-stories, considering the social impacts, designing system architectures)
- New technologies and programming languages
- Skills associated with working on a team and sponsor (leadership, communication, distributing work, reflecting and responding to feedback)
- How to resolve technical bugs and problems

## Results

- Created preliminary version of the app that allows the user to run a successful trial and collect data for the research study
- Built trial customization so that the user has free mobility to add certain instructions, choose between static vs interactive media, and rearrange order of stimuli presented
- Written a documentation guide as aid for using for the app and for future refactoring
Next steps include improving the UI and incorporating randomization of trials presented to participants
